IMPORTING MARZIPANO TO PANOMANAGER

This folder contains an instantiation of marzipano, however some changes have
been made to the files to support a directory hierarchy which is more akin to
that used by pannellum.

mtour.html is the main html file which is used to launch the viewer.  It is a 
modified version of index.html, and has two macros included: $TITLE$ and
$MZLIST$ which are expanded when the file is put in place.  In addition, the
file has been modified to expect all of the marzipano script and configuration
files in a marzipano subdirectory.

index.js has been renamed to mindex.js, and modified to expect the tour image 
files in the parent directory alongside mtour.html.

To import an updated version of Marzipano:

Create a new mtour.html if required, based on the marzipano index.html
Modify the marzipano index.js file to change the location of files, i.e. change:

    var urlPrefix = "tiles";
    var source = Marzipano.ImageUrlSource.fromString(
      urlPrefix + "/" + data.id + "/{z}/{f}/{y}/{x}.jpg",
      { cubeMapPreviewUrl: urlPrefix + "/" + data.id + "/preview.jpg" });

To:

    var source = Marzipano.ImageUrlSource.fromString(
      data.id + "/{z}/{f}{y}_{x}.jpg",
      { cubeMapPreviewUrl: data.id + "/1/f0_0.jpg" });

And:

    Globally replace all references to 'img/ with '/marzipano/img/
